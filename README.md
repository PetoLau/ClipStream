# ClipStream
The *ClipStream* is interpretable multiple data streams clustering method for sensor data.
It uses the *FeaClip* representation of time series streams that is implemented in my **R** package [**TSrepr**](https://github.com/PetoLau/TSrepr).

This repository is for sharing the source code for the paper: "Interpretable multiple data streams clustering with clipped streams representation for the improvement of electricity consumption forecasting". [Link to article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-018-0598-2).

Open data available for experiments: [London smart meter dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/41060).
